<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<img style="height:50%;" align="right" src="http://i.imgur.com/aNNS5xX.jpg"/>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
Lark is very dainty and lithe in her frame. Her physical strength isn't very high, but what she lacks in weight and muscle mass she makes up for in speed and endurance. She stands at five feet and nine inches in height, and her figure--while still distinctly feminine--is on the thinner side. While still noticeable enough to give her clothing a bump, her chest is relatively small, and her curves are very vaguely pronounced. Often times her hints of an hourglass figure are completely engulfed by her clothing. Her facial structure, while plain, is very symmetrical and has a pleasing aesthetic to it. Slender blonde brows sit above wide bright blue eyes, with a cute button nose and a pair of thin pink lips. Her hair is naturally very curly and mostly blonde with several pastel green sections bleeding through; common among those in the Winter Family.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Lark was raised to be prim, proper, and very analytical. She may often unintentionally come off as cold or distant since she was trained to behave like nobility. Beneath that surface lies a strong willed and passionate individual who cares deeply about those around her and has an intense desire to protect the things she loves.
<br><br>
<img style="height:50%;" align="left" src="http://i.imgur.com/vM8gKya.jpg"/>
<b>Attire</b><br>
Basphodius Citadel requires students to wear uniforms that slightly vary. There are two layers to her uniform. The first is the common attire she wears around campus (accurate description of the attire will come later) and the second being a dark cloak she must wear whenever attending to her Auror duties or leaving her home campus. The cloak itself is long enough to just reach past her knees. (Again, more descriptive when world lore is more fleshed out)

<h1>The Winter Family</h1>
Lord Waylan Warwick was a powerful Wizard with strong morals and values. Before the invasion and the beginning of the Ulreich Crisis, he worked as a humble benefactor; owning a shop that crafted potions and various artifacts for the general populace whether they be the wealthy, the noble, the simple, or even those in the military. When the invasion began, he and several of his close friends banded together to find a way to battle the overwhelming threat, and from the fruit of their efforts Basphodius Citadel was born. Lord Warwick's proud family consisted of only his three young daughters, as he had no siblings and his wife passed during the beginning of the crisis. All three followed in their father's footsteps, extensively and passionately studying the art of Witchcraft and paving their way into the magical world, gaining strength and supporting their father in his efforts. When they were old enough to be married and produce him grandchildren, he chose their husbands for them after a lot of thought. Each daughter was married off to a young man from different prestigious and well-bred noble families who had just a strong affinity for their own magic as his family did for Wizardry. The eldest daughter, who was named Eleanor, was given to another family of prestigious Wizards and married into the last name "Winter." The second eldest was named Ivy, and she was married into a family of Magus Manatists taking on the family name "Malowe." The third daughter, technically the youngest of the three and twin sister to the second eldest, was named Poppy, and she was wed into a family of Spiritualists thus taking on the name "Springfield."
<br><br>
Each family was very honored to carry on Warwick's legacy through his children, and their children's children, treating each daughter with great care. The Winters themselves were highly trained mages that specialized in the same tree as the man they admired. They founded a theory school to prepare well-bred students for their life of magic. If a child was going to specialize specifically in Wizardry, and had the proper breeding or a way to pay for the school's services, they would be put through a study program that not only went extensively through their tree of choice, but would also teach proper military etiquette. Cleanliness and organization was highly rewarded, and students were strictly prohibited from forming even their Paige Spells until they had achieved graduation from this prep school. From there they would be sent off to Basphodius Citadel.
<br><br>
The man Eleanor married was an only child with no siblings to speak of, so when the news spread that she was with child, all three families celebrated together. She first produced for him a son who was named Seymour, and just when it seemed like another generation of the Winter family was only going to have one child, Lark was born, six years her brother's minor. Another decent stretch of time passed, but eventually Eleanor gave her husband and her father yet another little boy, officially named "George" but far more commonly referred to as Georgie. The baby of the family was the final child to be born, sixteen years younger than the eldest, and ten years younger than Lark herself.
<br><br>
<h1>Lark's Childhood</h1>
<p align="center"><img style="width:60%;" src="http://i.imgur.com/2zyE7O0.gif"/></p>
Despite the rather large gap between each child's time of birth, Lark was unfortunate enough to get the short end of the stick. Like most well-bred stuffy nosed British families, she was in a constant state of competition for attention and any sort of affection with her own siblings. Her brother was a star pupil, a prodigy with promise who was spoiled from the start and cared little to nothing about anyone other than himself. He soaked up the glory when he could and often redirected attention away from his sister. She couldn't compete either, he had several years of experience on her, and despite that she could cast a Mana Spark as soon as she could walk, he was already forming elaborate curses and crafting quite the effective potions.
<br><br>
Lark was very heavily disciplined, she was the child who not only had to be the perfect image of proper obedience and great manners, but she also had the pressure of being perfect in body and mind. As a female it was her duty to someday be married off to some powerful rich mage, and she wasn't some naturally gorgeous face. In fact, the young Winter Wizard was quite plain looking. Despite all of this she did her best to please her relatives, going through extensive beauty treatments, being as obedient as was humanly possible, but every little mistake she made was magnified and her good deeds were never rewarded. Just when the promise of good grades and excellent performance at her own family's Prep school for Wizards was in her grasp, yet another child was born.
<br><br>
The baby of the family, Georgie, had absolutely no expectations. He was adorable, and that was enough for them. Despite his obvious talent with magic, when he got a bad score or did something wrong his head was pat and he got away with a promise to do better next time. The pressure, and the competition, increased its weight tenfold on their only daughter's shoulders.
<br><br>
<h1>Path to Becoming an Auror</h1>
By the time Lark Winter was finally sent to Basphodius Citadel, her demeanor and outlook on life were very cold. She became nothing more than a machine, working her hardest and wearing herself out in an attempt to sate her family's thirst for attention from the public. She graduated their prep school top of the class, her first developed spells weren't impressive but relatively clever, and while her sights were ambitious she didn't intend to become an Auror initially. But the longer she studied under the masters, the more time she spent in the dorms isolated from the corrupt ways of her own blood relatives, the more she discovered herself. As it turned out, she was just as passionate as her Grandfather, and a strong attachment to something he helped build grew inside of her.
<br><br>
Taking Manatism as her secondary tree, as was customary for those in the Winter family that actually practiced more than one tree, at her own High Mage ceremony the young mage made the ultimate decision, much to the horror of her own parents. Rather than dedicate her life to them, she showed her undying loyalty to the Academy, and chose to become an Auror.
<br><br>
Her defiance was not met with smiling or forgiving faces, and from that point on the only contact her father agreed to have with her was in order to discuss who she would be marrying. Lark lost all value to them, the only thing she had left was the ability to bear children and bring more honor to their name through her own descendants. Unfortunately, one taste of rebellion was not enough, and it seemed that the young Witch began to harbor strong romantic feelings for one of her superiors in Basphodius...
<br><br>
If she does not hurry and settle down by the time she reaches the age of twenty, her father will choose her consort for her, but something in her romantic interests sad eyes holds her back. Besides, there's no way he'd want to affiliate with a social outcast such as herself.
<br>

<h1>Gossip</h1>
<p align="center">Not everything listed here may be true, and not all of it may be false. These are a few random rumors anyone who attends Basphodius Citadel could either hear or spread themselves very easily.</p>
<br><br>
<li>“Did you hear the news? Wren Winter is being considered for another engineer’s promotion, Lark must be fuming! They say she’s jealous he gets to work her dream job and soak up all the attention.”</li>
<i>This would likely be heard whispered about on Campus to some variation. As upstanding high society and extremely wealthy members of Ultimurus, the Winters would be a common subject of gossip, especially since one of the members is currently attending their establishment. Lark Winter is a well known cold shoulder, a blunt and hostile individual whose behavior seemed to grow even worse when the news of her brother’s promotion reached her. It can very easily be assumed that her reaction has to do with jealousy.</i>
<br><br>
<li>“Their strongest and most capable mage is, like, practically a toddler. What a joke, hope that wipes the smug grins off their faces.”</li>
<i>Most media presented about the Winters would center around the development of their eldest and youngest sons, especially the youngest. His sickly stature and round face make him appear even younger than he already is, and is admittedly young for having the magic skill he has shown. It is not uncommon to see him only as the “sweetest child in existence,” and his gossip record keeps updates for the tiniest development, making him the topic of conversation far more frequent than the topic of his elder brother, or even his parents. These facts pooling together make it safe to assume he is their strongest.</i>
<br><br>
<li>“Lark’s been carted here on purpose, her parents are just getting lazy at this point. I know this place isn’t a walk in the park either, but think about it! Big brother and baby brother both get the best private tutors money can buy, and what does she get, a scholarship to some academy? If that doesn’t scream favoritism I don’t know what does!”</li>
<i>The Winters would be flaunting their son’s education to the public, but barely anyone would even remember Lark existed until she began attending the Basphodius Citadel. The realization that there was a Winter daughter at all would spread like wildfire, and with it curious gazes. Why did her brothers get such special treatment and attention while she faded into obscurity? Even her progress at the academy itself was never documented for the public once. Lark’s habit of stonewalling any questions, and the apparent favoritism, have led to many people drawing this conclusion.</i>
<br><br>
<li>“The Winters have their own private trolley car on the inner-city system. They must have bought the entire track!...or at least paid the right people. Can you imagine? What a waste of resources!"</li>
<i>It is no secret that the Winters do not hold back a cent when it comes to luxury. They are proud of their money, and are constantly drawing attention to their wealth as though it defines their personal worth. They would certainly make it well known that the inner-city train system (or systems) carts around an entire private car just for them. That fact combined with the flaunted knowledge that they possess their own out-of-city railroad and more than one train might lead to the conclusion that they bought off a few inner-city railroad rights.</i>
<br><br>
<li>“The only reason she’s getting an education at all is because they want to marry her off, and all the other decent mage families won’t take some useless girl, they want mages. They just want her bloodline so they can breed powerful warriors.”</li>
<i>It is not uncommon for the daughters of wealthy families to be married off to other wealthy families for the sake of political gain and the chance to breed powerful mages, as well as buy off favors and form alliances. This would be a popular topic of discussion only surrounding females, since pampered women were usually only useful around the house for producing offspring. Considering that her brothers get a proper private tutelage and she has been dumped on a school’s doorstep, coming to this conclusion would be easy.</i>
<br><br>
<li>“Lark just wants to be free, getting tied down to a man and a family would be torture for a girl like her.”</li>
<i>Since marriage would be a common topic of gossip around the young Witch, it would not be unlikely to hear some variation of this in passing. Her hostility toward people in general makes her appear to be a loner by choice, and her obvious discontent with the idea of being arranged into a marriage allows one to assume she would rather not have a ring on her finger at all.</i>

<h1>Witchcraft; Auror</h1>
<i>"It's debatable that Wizardry offers more utility than any other tree. They provide a number of banes and boons through the use of Artifacts, Curses, Hexes and Potions, but lack a lot of fire power when in comparison to most of the other trees. Artifacts are, for lack of a better word, enchanted objects that can provide passive, or temporary/activated, buffs to the wielder or affect a given area upon being activated. Curses are banes to be cast on other people that can inflict a number of status effects on them. They're capable of doing damage, but only to a limited extent, and can not actually have the capacity to kill until High Mage. A hex is a spell that places an effect on a given item, and can be placed on multiple items. Potions are, as you might have guessed, a concoction of different ingredients that must be gathered prior to making the potion that might provide a desired effect when consumed, or act as a poison. Wizards are also, outside of faith mages, the only mages that can remove curses.​"</i>

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Magus Manatism; Mage</h1>
<i>"The epitome of mana manipulation. Those that take this tree end up taking their skills in this art to levels so ridiculous they can solidify their mana into all shapes and sizes. Manatists start off with an advanced form of mana manipulation that makes them just a bit more adept at Paige rank with their skill than others. This of course doesn't stop being a fact as they rank up and as they learn spells, but lose their edge as their peers get more experienced. With their inate ability at mana manipulation, they are able to learn universal spells that are meant for those a rank above them and below.  Without a question of a doubt, their trump card comes in the form of an advanced form of mana, the purest a mage could possibly make. Arcane energy is a very volatile and destructive force, one that takes much time to master but is fully worth the journey from Expert Mage to the upper ranks available to mages. Some even say its power cannot be matched at its zenith."</i>
</div>
<div id="tab6">
<h1>Spiritualism; Beginner Mage</h1>
<i>"Arguably one of the most powerful trees; Spiritualists possess the ability to speak to and beseech the spirits around themselves. This often requires much time, and also requires the spirits to agree with the mage's cause. One without conviction will not do well within this study. Spiritualists gain access to a unique mana type at Mage rank, which has been deemed "Spirit Force." Spirit Force has the capability to heal the soul, and at some level the flesh as well.​"</i>
